## About

This project was an "air-drop" follow up to [Hexagones Art for Bots](https://revdancatt.com/art/Hexagones_Art_for_Bots-8324). The assumption being that once the bot networks had bought up and then flipped that project so it was now mainly owned by humans, that I'd send (for free) a more advanced version of the project to them.

This updated version included many more visual elements, including the first appearance of the "broken" chevron design that would later appear in [FALLiNGWATER](https://revdancatt.com/art/FALLiNGWATER-fallingwater). Those elements could be toggled on and off using various keys, and an "attract mode" was added, started by pressing 'f' for "Flickr" mode, a 30 second sequence of turning various element on and off.
